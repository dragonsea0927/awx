# Issues

## Reporting 

Use the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues) for filing bugs. In order to save time, and help us respond to issues quickly, make sure to fill out as much of the issue template
as possible. Version information, and an accurate reproducing scenario are critical to helping us identify the problem.

Please don't use the issue tracker as a way to ask how to do something. Instead, use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/awx-project) , and the `#ansible-awx` channel on irc.freenode.net to get help.

Before opening a new issue, please use the issue search feature to see if what you're experiencing has already been reported. If you have any extra detail to provide, please comment. Otherwise, rather than posting a "me too" comment, please consider giving it a ["thumbs up"](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comment) to give us an indication of the severity of the problem.

### UI Issues

When reporting issues for the UI, we also appreciate having screen shots and any error messages from the web browser's console. It's not unusual for browser extensions
and plugins to cause problems. Reporting those will also help speed up analyzing and resolving UI bugs.

### API and backend issues 

For the API and backend services, please capture all of the logs that you can from the time the problem occurred.

## How issues are resolved

We triage our issues into high, medium, and low, and tag them with the relevant component (e.g. api, ui, installer, etc.). We typically focus on higher priority issues first. There aren't hard and fast rules for determining the severity of an issue, but generally high priority issues have an increased likelihood of breaking existing functionality, and negatively impacting a large number of users.

If your issue isn't considered high priority, then please be patient as it may take some time to get to it.
